# Buzzwords

Don't be sacred by this hard words.Let's see them one by one:

### Optimization Technique

Optimization Technique dictates Technique through which loss function is optimized.In informal words basically how your network get tweaked.See [Pros and Cons of diffrent Techniques](#Choose-Optimization-Technique).

### Loss Function

Loss function basically is one function which measures error in whole network.Goal of Optimization Technique is to minimize value of this Loss Function.See [See Usage of different Losss Functions](#Choose-Loss-Function).

### Learning rate

This is the number which controls the speed of learning.For ex. ```0``` means no learning and ```1``` means Full paced learning.See [See Choosing right learning rate](#Choose-Learning-rate).

### Weights Intialization

As you know before training weights of network must be intialized.And Weights Intialization dictates Technique through which weights get intialized.See [Pros and Cons of diffrent Techniques](#Choose-Weights-Intialization).

### Epochs

Epoch is number which dictates how many times training should be done on training data.
For Ex:
3 : Do training on training data 3 times.

See [Pros and Cons of diffrent Epochs](#Choose-Epochs)

### Validation

Validation Data is basically testing data derived from training/testing data.It can be used to see if model is overfitting/underfitting.

### Choose Optimization Technique

| Optimizer | Convergence Speed |Convergence Quality|
| --- | --- | --- |
| SGD | # |###|
| Adagrad | ### |#|
| RMSprop | ### |## or ###|
| Adam | ### |## or ###|
| Nadam | ### |## or ###|
| AdaMax | ### |## or ###|

You should always choose optimizer according to available data and timeconstraint.

### Choose Loss function


### Choose Learning rate

![choose_loss](https://github.com/imdeep2905/Neural-Network-Sandbox/blob/master/Frontend/imgs/choose_loss.png)

Actually it's little hard to select just right learning rate for your project.Feel free to experiment with different learning rates and see which one gives best results.

Our Advice is to start with smaller learning rate and gradually increase it untill you find best one.

### Choose Weights Intialization

### Choose Epochs

Guessing right number of epochs also require experience.But you can start with less epochs and gradually increase it untill you find best one for your project.
